There are many ways to build an LED based bulb to replace an incandescent, and regardless of size, ACME has it covered. From the most popular T10 and 3157 fitments to 921 and Festoons, we offer something that's fashionable and shines bright. Most of our products use domestic or Korean LED chips, but on some specialty models we do integrate CREE and Lumiled LEDs. White. Amber. Red. Switchback, we've got it all! </p>

Our LED Accent Lighting lineup definitely delivers, and from the time you turn 'em on we're sure you'll be sold. No fancy phosphor coatings here, just tightly packed LEDs on a flexible (and paint-able) circuit board that packs a sure punch when illuminated. No matter the style, our setups are designed with external drivers for easy serviceability outside the headlamp enclosure, and can be ordered in most any strip length. No frills here. We use only proven, mature technology and production techniques to produce a good looking and reliable product for you. </p>

                        <p>While LED headlight bulbs continue to become more and more popular, the fact is that the more mature HID technology still proves better when it comes to putting light on the road. ACME's Standard Series HID headlight bulbs are every bit as good as the best in the aftermarket due to the simple fact the technology reached its peak many moons ago. Therefore, we (and our customers) don't need to be the industry's top spenders to access current-day production techniques and raw materials. Here, ACME believes that to strive for average is synonymous with not trying at all. Our Standard bulbs deliver above average performance at a below average price.</p>

                        <p>We may be the bargain brand, but we don't fill our ballasts with sand. While there's something to be said for getting a good deal, ACME insists that it's only OK to cut costs when it can't affect your safety. Becoming the industry standard for value means delivering the right proportion of bang for the buck; so while our ballasts aren't anywhere near the cheapest, they deliver stable quality that you can confide in. The SpeedyStart 35w competes with more expensive options from competitors like Hylux, Morimoto, and CNLight. On the other hand, nobody else offers anything comparable to the 75W Dynamite's designed for off-road use. </p>

                        <p>The lineup includes common fitments for all bulb sizes including D2S, D1S, D3S, and H1. Designed with three things in mind. First and foremost, light output - because if you're going to upgrade your headlamps and up the output, it's important that the added light end up on the ground where it belongs, not in the eyes of oncoming traffic. Second, ease of installation. Because if its not easy to install, users will opt-out or face errors that could compromise the result. Lastly, value. Because we're not Morimoto, nor are we trying to be the benchmark. But by acquiring their old tooling and putting it back into service - we're able to deliver yesterday's benchmark projectors to you, today, at a fraction of what they sold for when they were the latest and greatest. </p>

                            <h4 class="text-tanlight large">Long story short</h4>
                            <p class="large">Performance lighting for the automotive world is popular. With millions of cars and trucks on the road rocking headlight tech designed during the stone ages; inevitably the demand for something that will allow drivers to see better while traveling at night is there. Likewise, we recognize the fact that many if not most of the vehicles on the road equipped with inadequate headlights aren't brand new cars. They are owned, driven, and maintained by everyday people. Everyday people who just want something better and can afford it on an average joe budget. </p>

                            <p class="large">ACME Delivers real lighting performance at the right price. By using technology and left-over tooling taken from yesterday's high-end; we make today's average, we make it affordable, and we're proud of it! And unless you're a lighting snob with a lumen meter built into your brain, we're pretty sure you won't see the subtle difference between a product you bought from ACME at a bargain and the premium brands for twice the price. Our production lines in southern China turn out some of the most recognizable parts in the industry today. Search Amazon, Alibaba, or almost any online retail store who sells HID kits for cars or LED kits for trucks and you'll probably find something from our line private labeled under brand X, Y, or Z. Look closer though and you'll see that it's all the same stuff, and it all comes out of the same place. But that's A-okay, because even though it may be basic, it works well and it's affordable, and that's why so many brands trust us to deliver the goods. HID and LED Headlight Projectors, HID Ballasts, HID Bulbs, LED Bulbs, and LED Accent Lighting. We supply generic, private-label, and self-branded parts to dealers all over the world. We do it all and our mission always was and always will be to deliver Real Performance at the Right Price. </p>
